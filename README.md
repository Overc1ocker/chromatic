[Chromatic VR](https://chromatic.funktroniclabs.com/) is an WebVR audiovisual experiment created using realtime shaders and generative audio. Watch iridescent shards of light unfurl into procedurally generated prismatic realms and meditative soundscapes.

This project was developed using various web frameworks including [three.js](https://threejs.org/), an open source 3D library, and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/), a framework for creating interactive audio.

Requires a VR HMD and [WebVR friendly browser](https://webvr.info/) in order to run properly.
